## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm run install:browsers
```

2. Configure `.env`:

```env
BASE_URL=https://test-billing.empcloud.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@acme.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-password
TIMEOUT=60000
HEADLESS=true
```

`ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are required for the authenticated invoice and vendor flows. The registration suite does not use those credentials.
Protected modules use a Playwright auth setup project that saves `storageState` under `playwright/.auth/` and reuses that session across authenticated specs.

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
npm run test:health
npm run test:invoice
npm run test:quotes
npm run test:payments
npm run test:registration
npm run test:vendor
npm run test:headed
npm run report
```

## Test Coverage

- `client`: authenticated client creation flow
- `health`: basic application availability check
- `invoice`: authenticated simple invoice creation flow
- `quotes`: authenticated simple quote creation flow
- `payments`: authenticated payment recording flow
- `registration`: public registration page coverage with positive and validation scenarios
- `vendor`: authenticated vendor creation flow

## Notes

- `.env` values are loaded quietly to keep Playwright output readable.
- Test data reads credentials from environment variables instead of hardcoding them in specs.
- Registration test data generates unique emails and organization names per run to reduce collisions.
- Specs are grouped by feature under `tests/specs/`.
- Shared login and UI interaction helpers live under `tests/utils/`.
- Generated references and vendor emails are unique per run to reduce data collisions.
- Authenticated modules run through `tests/specs/auth/auth.setup.js` first so a single saved session can be reused across protected flows.

## Verification

- The suite layout and scripts are documented for `client`, `health`, `invoice`, `payments`, `registration`, and `vendor`.
- Registration coverage is intentionally isolated from auth helpers so it can validate the public sign-up page directly.
- In this workspace, Playwright/Node verification may fail with a local `EPERM` path permission issue under `C:\Users\Aayush Gupta`.
